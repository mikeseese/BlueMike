Android Bluetooth infrastructure-less P2P Network

Initially created to support multiplayer games requiring an
infrastructure-less network (in comparison of typical server-client
network or one which requires a WiFi AP). Initially written for <a href="https://github.com/seesemichaelj/BallSlappers">BallSlappers</a>,
this library was never incorporated due to other reasons. This can
be used for applications wishing to implement a mesh-like network.

This library is mostly a proof-of-concept and is not supported
by the developer.

However, with the Android 4.0+ WiFi P2P libraries, this library has become
obsolete, despite it was never used for a real application.

You can find a test application which implements this library at <a href="https://github.com/seesemichaelj/BlueMikeTest">BlueMikeTest</a>.
